## What is GG-CMS?
GG-CMS (GoGo-Content Management System) is a content management system in short, allows you to create your own blog and manage your own content.

Right now is early stage, but the plan is to add more features in futures versions

Here is a list of the features in the current version **V0.1**:
* Manage Posts (Create, Delete, Update and Get)
* Manage Users with admin role
* JWT (Json Web Token) Implementation for security

**Note:**
**This is only the Back-End of the complete project, please click in the link below to go to the Front-End repository and demo page link:**

* [Demo Page](https://gg-cms-demo.devland.bid/)


## Implementation GG-CMS
For implementing this back-end you need to have the following considerations:
* All the configuration is via Environment variables which mean you need to setup first:
    * `PORT` : Is optional because the mayor part of the server implementation use that variable to set the port automatically
    * `GGCMSDBString` : Is to set the server connection string to MongoDB, here are sine examples:
        * Set with only server ip or name `mongodb://<IP OR SERVERNAME>` or with credentials to access the MongoDB server `mongodb://[username]:[password]@<IP OR SERVERNAME>`
    * `GGCMSDBProd` : Here is the database that is use in the enviroment
    * `GGCMSDBTest` : Here is the database that is use for the integrations testing **Note: the database is created at the start and destroyed at the end of all tests**
    * `ESPECIAL_USER` : Is a user that going to work only if you not have any user in the database. Example of how to setup:
        * `[username]:[password]`
    * `JWT_SECRET` : Was created to change the default secret key used to encode the JWT.
